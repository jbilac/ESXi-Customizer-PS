## Welcome to the ESXi-Customizer-PS GitHub Pages

Full documentation is currently available at the [V-Front.de web site](https://esxi-customizer-ps.v-front.de) and will be gradually migrated to this location.

This fork is for any filesystem that uses / instead of \ in their paths, as this powershell script contains several hardcoded forward slashes. For personal reasons, I have also modified log behaviour to log in the directory the script is invoked from by default, so utlize -log to change this behaviour if required.
